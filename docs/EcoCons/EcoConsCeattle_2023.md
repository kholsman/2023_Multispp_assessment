## Summary statement:
While warm water temperatures continue to drive high individual predator demand for prey, declines in groundfish biomass combined with increased recruitment has resulted in net declines in estimates of predation mortality for juvenile groundfish in recent years. This pattern indicates continued favorable top-down conditions for juvenile groundfish survival in 2022 through 2023 via predation release.

## Status and trends:  

The climate-enhanced multispecies model (CEATTLE) estimates of age 1 natural mortality (i.e., M1+M2) for walleye pollock (hereafter “pollock”), Pacific cod (hereafter “P. cod”), and arrowtooth flounder continue to decline from the 2016 peak mortality. For all three species, age 1 predation mortality rates have remained similar to 2022. At 1.2 yr$^{-1}$, age 1 mortality estimated by the model was greatest for pollock and lower for P. cod and arrowtooth, with total age 1 natural mortality at around 0.65 and 0.66 yr$^{-1}$ for P. cod and arrowtooth, respectively. 2023 age 1 natural mortality across species is 11% to 39% lower than in  2016
and is near average for pollock (relative to the long-term mean) (Fig. 1). Similarly, P. cod and arrowtooth age 1 mortality are well below the long-term mean.

Patterns in the total biomass of each species consumed by all three predators in the model (typically 1-3 yr old fish) exhibit divergent trends from predation mortality in 2023. Pollock and P. cod biomass consumed by all predators in the model is trending upward (indicated more pollock and P. cod were consumed this year than in previous years), while arrowtooth consumed is trending downward (Fig. 2).

## Factors influencing observed trends

Temporal patterns in natural mortality reflect annually varying changes in predation mortality that primarily impact age 1 fish (and to a lesser degree impact ages 2 and 3 fish in the model). Pollock are primarily consumed by older conspecifics, and pollock cannibalism accounts for 59% (on average) of total age 1 predation mortality, with the exception of the years 2006-2008 when predation by arrowtooth marginally exceeded cannibalism as the largest source of predation mortality of age 1 pollock (Fig. 3). The relative proportion of age 1 pollock consumed by older pollock and arrowtooth increased again in 2023 relative to previous years, while the relative proportion consumed by P. cod and arrowtooth declined slightly.

Combined annual predation demand (annual ration) of pollock, P. cod, and arrowtooth flounder in 2023 was 9.26 million tons, down slightly from the 9.99 million t annual average during the warm years and large maturing cohorts of 2014-2016. Walleye pollock represent approximately 77% of the model estimates of combined prey consumed with a long-term average of 5.73 million tons of pollock consumed annually by all three predators in the model. From 2015 - 2019,individual annual rations were above average for all three predator species, driven by anomalously warm water temperatures in the Bering Sea during during those years (Fig. 4). However, cooler temperatures in 2023 relative to the recent warm years has resulted in annual rations at or below the long-term average (Fig. 4).

## Implications: 

We find evidence of continued declines in predation mortality of age 1 pollock, P. cod and arrowtooth flounder relative to recent high predation years (2014 - 2016). While warm temperatures continue to lead to high metabolic (and energetic) demand of predators, declines in total predator biomass, in particular P. cod, are contributing to an net decrease in total consumption (relative to 2016) and therefore reduced predation rates and mortality in 2021-2023. This pattern indicates continued favorable top-down conditions for juvenile groundfish survival in 2022 through predator release due to declining biomass of groundfish.

Between 1980 and 1993, relatively high natural mortality rates for pollock reflect patterns in combined annual demand for pollock prey by all three predators that was highest in the mid 1980’s (collectively 9.24 million t per year). The peak in predation mortality of age 1 pollock in 2016 corresponds to warmer than average conditions and higher than average energetic demand of predators combined with the maturation of the large 2010-2012 year classes of pollock and P. cod (collectively with arrowtooth 10.07 million t per year). 

## Description of index: 

We report trends in age 1 total mortality for walleye pollock (_Gadus chalcogrammus_), P. cod (_Gadus macrocephalus_) and arrowtooth flounder (_Atheresthes stomias_), from the eastern Bering Sea (USA). Total mortality rates are based on residual mortality inputs (M1) and model estimates of annual predation mortality (M2) produced from the multi-species statistical catch-at-age assessment model (known as CEATTLE; Climate-Enhanced, Age-based model with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics). See Appendix1 of the BSAI pollock stock assessment (Ianelli et al. 2023), Holsman et al. (2016), Holsman and Aydin (2015), Ianelli et al. (2016), and Jurado-Molina et al. (2005) for more information.
